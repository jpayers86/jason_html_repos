            Here is an example of a blockquote:
            <blockquote>
                I wonder if we should go to tahoe to ski.
                Or maybe just vermont or just stay local. I hear
                Sunday River is good too.
            </blockquote>
            That was a blockquote!<br/>
            <code>Code text goes here.</code><br/>
            <!-- This is a comment and will not display. I don't think I can afford tahoe.
            Or any place else. -->
